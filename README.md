This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

The web pages will contain two parts, one is the home page and one is my Raspberry Pi status page, including system information, CPU usage and memory usage.
